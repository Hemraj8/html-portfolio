<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Interstellar is a mesmerizing cinematic experience that transcends the boundaries of science fiction. Christopher Nolan, the visionary director behind this masterpiece, has crafted a film that captivates and challenges the mind in equal measure. From the breathtaking visuals to the compelling storytelling, Interstellar takes its audience on an awe-inspiring journey through space and time.

<h3>18 Pages</h3>
<p>18 pages' is implausible and fanciful and normally, I wouldn't get through a movie this unrealistic. However, somehow this does work, and I think, in part, it's the plot device of 2 people connecting through a diary, not in real time. The diary takes on a magical, transcendent quality.

<h3>Vikram</h3>
<p>VIKRAM is a Treat to Watch with Spectacular Performances from All The Actors !!! Filmmaker Lokesh Kanagaraj uses the talent of actors Fahadh Faasil, Vijay Sethupathi and Kamal Haasan brilliantly in his latest venture Vikram</p>
