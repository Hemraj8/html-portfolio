<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Hemraj, an 18-year-old computer science engineering student in my first year at SRM University in Andhra Pradesh. My interests revolve around computer science and technology, and I'm always eager to learn and explore this field.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar and basketball. The guitar helps me unwind and relax, and I find joy in the simplicity of strumming a tune. On the other hand, I'm a casual basketball player, and I like shooting some hoops with friends when I get the chance.</p>
<p>I'm not one for big self-introductions, but I'm always open to making new friends and engaging in interesting conversations. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat or share experiences.</p>
